### What is the primary purpose (Mission) for the Reporting?

The users will mostly view the Reports on their desktops but may be 
distributed with email (attached PDF files) and other tools e.g. NPrinting


### The Reporting requirements will provide a detailed view of:
* Sales vs Target performance
* Sales vs Profit performance
* Stock Levels 

### Functional requirements

* Clear selections easily
* Default Sales vs Target sheet to first 6 months of 2020 when opening
* Default Sales vs Profit sheet to first 6 months of 2020 & Big TV (Screens) when opening

###Branding
* Colourize the Sheet Title bar to company brand colour
* Show corporate thumbnail image in Top RH Corner of title bar
* Prototype Sales pivot tables in a more visually appealing form e.g. source an extension
